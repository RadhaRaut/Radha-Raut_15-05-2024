Types of feild:
1. static ( we can call direct without creating an object).
          ( declare inside the static block).
2. Non- Static( object creation is mandatory for non static).

static keyword: we use static keyword for better/efficient memory management in java.
		        -we use static keyword, to declare fields, methods and blocks.
		        
 this keyword: when non-static fields names and constructor/method parameter names are same,
               then we use 'this' keyword to differentiate non-static fields from
               constructor/method parameters.
              -this keyword we use to point the current class properties.
              
 Encapsulation: Collecting related data /functionality together but individually.
               -Mostly it used in class designing .
               -It is nothing but the data segregation.
 Example: 
 public class Product {
    private int productId;
	private String productName;
	private double productPrice;
	}
	
instanceof keyword-The instanceof keyword compares the instance with type. 
                  -The return value is either true or false.
